#NIGHT OF THE DEVIL

##I. High Concept
	A 2D side-scrolling game in which the player progresses through the level while defeating enemies, gaining powerups, and executing combos with their attacks and abilities while utilizing swift movement controls. Gameplay is like Castlevania with a platform-fighter style twist.

##II. Genre
	A side scrolling action adventure game.

##III. Platform
	Desktop only web-game.

##IV. Story
	It’s a stormy night and our brave hero, who has trained for years mastering all the weapons he can get his hands on, must storm the orc stronghold and stop them before their leader completes a ritual to summon an ancient evil back into the world.

##V. Esthetics
	The graphic style will be crisp pixel art, similar to Castlevania and Metroid style, trying to put emphasis on gritty realism with detailed monsters and occasional gore. The sounds will be 8-bit, most of the sound effects will be when the player and enemies attack, get hit, and die. Background music will accompany the game and will change per level/area.

##VI. Gameplay
	####Mechanics:
	The player will be able to run left and right, jump, and use a dash for extra mobility. By killing enemies or looting chests, the player will have the ability to acquire more powerful weapons to aid them in their quest. All weapons will be different and be used in a unique fashion. There will be fast weapons that dish out low amounts of damage very quickly, slow weapons that decimate hitpoints, and many weapons in between.

####Control:
The game will be played using the left and right arrow keys for movement. Keys such as Z, X, C, A, S, and D will be used for attacking and other actions like jumping and dashing.

####New User Experience:
The user will discover how the play the game as they it for the first time. At the start, basic movement tutorials will be provided at the bottom of the screen (similar to how the Binding of Isaac has the basic movements in the starting room). It is then up to the user to find out how each of the different weapons and equipments work throughout the game. Flavor text will be provided for any permanent equipment that the user picks up (such as saying “Defense Up!” when they pick up better armor), but nothing will be provided when they pick up a new weapons except for the name of the weapon. This is to make using new weapons a bit of a surprise and more fun for the first time player. Instead of glossing over a weapon whose description is boring, they will instead pick up almost all the new weapons they find and have fun exploring the possibilities (kind of how Risk of Rain doesn’t directly tell the user what any of the powerups really do).
	
####Player Learning:
In order to beat the game, the player should be well versed in a variety of different weapons and be able to utilize their characters movement to their best ability. Additionally, they should be familiar with all the enemies and their unique attack patterns and weak points. Knowing when to dash in and attack and when certain aggressive options will get punished by the enemies is key for success.
